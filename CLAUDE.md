# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an AI-powered SysML diagram generator built with FastAPI (backend) and React (frontend). The system uses OpenAI's GPT models to generate SysML diagrams from natural language descriptions, with optional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using pgvector for semantic search. The application runs in Docker containers with PostgreSQL as the database.

## Architecture

### Backend Structure
- **FastAPI Application** (`app/main.py`): Main API server with CORS middleware
- **API Routes** (`app/api/api_v1.py`): Router aggregation for all endpoints
- **AI Generation** (`app/AI/diagram_generation.py`): OpenAI integration for SysML diagram generation
- **Database Models** (`app/database/models.py`): SQLAlchemy models for embeddings, templates, and components
- **RAG System** (`app/database/rag_router.py`): Retrieval-Augmented Generation endpoints
- **Configuration** (`app/core/config.py`): Pydantic settings management

### Frontend Structure
- **React + TypeScript** with Material-UI components
- **State Management**: Zustand store (`src/store/diagramStore.ts`)
- **Diagram Editor**: React Flow integration for visual editing
- **AI Integration**: Hooks for AI generation (`src/hooks/useAIGeneration.ts`)
- **SysML Components**: Custom nodes and edges for SysML elements

### Key Components

#### SysML Node Types
- `block`: General system blocks
- `sensor`: Sensor components  
- `processor`: Processing components
- Located in `frontend/src/components/nodes/`

#### Database Schema
- `diagram_embeddings`: Stores diagrams with vector embeddings for RAG
- `sysml_templates`: Reusable diagram templates
- `uav_components`: UAV-specific component definitions

## Environment Configuration

Required environment variables in `.env`:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
OPENAI_GENERATIVE_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://postgres:postgres@db:5432/postgres
DB_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgres@db:5432/postgres
```

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/v1/ping`: Health check
- `POST /api/v1/create-diagram/`: Generate diagram without RAG
- `POST /api/v1/rag/generate-diagram-with-context/`: Generate diagram with RAG
- Database endpoints for embeddings, templates, and components

## Development Notes

- Backend uses Poetry for dependency management
- Frontend uses Vite for development and building
- Database migrations managed with Alembic
- pgvector extension required for semantic search
- OpenAI embeddings use 1536-dimensional vectors
- Diagram positioning is handled automatically by Dagre layout algorithm

### Changelog Maintenance

**After completing each task, you must update the changelog:**

1. **Update CHANGELOG.md**: Add a summary of the changes to the `[Unreleased]` section
2. **Increment Version**: Create a new version entry with incremented patch version (e.g., 1.1.0 â†’ 1.1.1)
3. **Update .env**: Update both `APP_VERSION` and `VITE_APP_VERSION` to match the new version
4. **Categorize Changes**: Use the following categories:
   - `Added` for new features
   - `Changed` for changes in existing functionality
   - `Deprecated` for soon-to-be removed features
   - `Removed` for now removed features
   - `Fixed` for any bug fixes
   - `Security` for vulnerability fixes

**Example workflow:**
```markdown
## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.1] - 2025-07-08
### Added
- New feature implementation

### Fixed  
- Bug fix description
```

**Important**: Always follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) principles.

## Testing

Backend tests are located in `backend/app/test/` and use pytest with async support. Run tests with `poetry run pytest` in the backend directory.

## Deployment

The application is containerized and deploys with Docker Compose. Services:
- `backend`: FastAPI server on port 8000
- `frontend`: Nginx serving React build on port 3000  
- `db`: PostgreSQL with pgvector on port 5432


## Current State

The application now features a **tabbed interface** for managing multiple diagrams simultaneously. Key components include:

### Multi-Diagram State Management
- **DiagramInstance Interface**: Each tab represents a diagram with `id`, `name`, `type`, `nodes`, `edges`, and timestamps
- **Zustand Store**: Manages `openDiagrams` array and `activeDiagramId` with actions for opening, closing, and switching tabs
- **Legacy Compatibility**: Maintains backward compatibility with existing single-diagram operations

### Tabbed Interface Components
- **DiagramTabs** (`src/components/DiagramTabs.tsx`): Tab bar with Material-UI styling, close buttons, and add new tab functionality
- **DiagramWorkspace** (`src/components/DiagramWorkspace.tsx`): Main ReactFlow canvas area with integrated toolbar and panels
- **App Layout**: Flex-based layout with sidebar, workspace, and generator panel

### Key Features
- Browser-like tab experience with switching and closing
- Automatic tab creation from AI generation
- Empty state handling when no diagrams are open
- All original functionality preserved (save, export, validation, etc.)

### new task

Task Type: UI/UX Improvement
Title: Relocate Canvas Toolbar to the Bottom
Project: AI-Powered SysML Modeling Tool
Description
The current toolbar for canvas management (zoom, save, validate, etc.) is located at the top of the DiagramWorkspace, directly above the diagram itself.
Goal: To create a cleaner and more minimalist interface where the main focus is on the diagram, this toolbar needs to be moved from the top of the canvas to the bottom. The new location should be just above the status bar (where the node and connection counts are displayed).
As a result, the functionality of all buttons on the toolbar must be fully preserved, and the interface's appearance will become more balanced and modern.
Acceptance Criteria
The Toolbar is visually located at the bottom of the canvas workspace, above the bottom status bar.
The toolbar remains horizontally centered.
All controls on the toolbar (Undo, Redo, Zoom In/Out, Fit View, Delete, Save, Validate, Export) function exactly as before.
The position change does not break the overall layout or responsiveness of the DiagramWorkspace component.
The change applies to all diagram tabs, not just the active one.
Technical Implementation Details
Primary file to modify: frontend/src/components/DiagramWorkspace.tsx. This component contains the rendering logic for the React Flow canvas and the integrated toolbar.
Technology Stack: React, TypeScript, Material-UI, React Flow.
Recommended Approach:
In the DiagramWorkspace.tsx file, locate the container that wraps the toolbar and the ReactFlow component. It's most likely a Material-UI Box or Stack using display: 'flex' and flex-direction: 'column'.
To move the toolbar down, change the order of the child elements within this flex container. The simplest way is to change the order of the JSX elements, placing the toolbar component after the ReactFlow component.
Check that the margins and padding around the toolbar look correct in its new position. You may need to move a top margin to a bottom margin.
Important: Ensure that the logic associated with the toolbar (e.g., functions passed via props) was not broken during the JSX code relocation.
After completing the task, remember to update CHANGELOG.md and the version in .env according to the instructions in the CLAUDE.md file.
