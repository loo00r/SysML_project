# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an AI-powered SysML diagram generator built with FastAPI (backend) and React (frontend). The system uses OpenAI's GPT models to generate SysML diagrams from natural language descriptions, with optional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using pgvector for semantic search. The application runs in Docker containers with PostgreSQL as the database.

## Architecture

### Backend Structure
- **FastAPI Application** (`app/main.py`): Main API server with CORS middleware
- **API Routes** (`app/api/api_v1.py`): Router aggregation for all endpoints
- **AI Generation** (`app/AI/diagram_generation.py`): OpenAI integration for SysML diagram generation
- **Database Models** (`app/database/models.py`): SQLAlchemy models for embeddings, templates, and components
- **RAG System** (`app/database/rag_router.py`): Retrieval-Augmented Generation endpoints
- **Configuration** (`app/core/config.py`): Pydantic settings management

### Frontend Structure
- **React + TypeScript** with Material-UI components
- **State Management**: Zustand store (`src/store/diagramStore.ts`)
- **Diagram Editor**: React Flow integration for visual editing
- **AI Integration**: Hooks for AI generation (`src/hooks/useAIGeneration.ts`)
- **SysML Components**: Custom nodes and edges for SysML elements

### Key Components

#### SysML Node Types
- `block`: General system blocks
- `sensor`: Sensor components  
- `processor`: Processing components
- Located in `frontend/src/components/nodes/`

#### Database Schema
- `diagram_embeddings`: Stores diagrams with vector embeddings for RAG
- `sysml_templates`: Reusable diagram templates
- `uav_components`: UAV-specific component definitions

## Environment Configuration

Required environment variables in `.env`:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
OPENAI_GENERATIVE_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://postgres:postgres@db:5432/postgres
DB_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgres@db:5432/postgres
```

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/v1/ping`: Health check
- `POST /api/v1/create-diagram/`: Generate diagram without RAG
- `POST /api/v1/rag/generate-diagram-with-context/`: Generate diagram with RAG
- Database endpoints for embeddings, templates, and components

## Development Notes

- Backend uses Poetry for dependency management
- Frontend uses Vite for development and building
- Database migrations managed with Alembic
- pgvector extension required for semantic search
- OpenAI embeddings use 1536-dimensional vectors
- Diagram positioning is handled automatically by Dagre layout algorithm

### Changelog Maintenance

**After completing each task, you must update the changelog:**

1. **Update CHANGELOG.md**: Add a summary of the changes to the `[Unreleased]` section
2. **Increment Version**: Create a new version entry with incremented patch version (e.g., 1.1.0 → 1.1.1)
3. **Update .env**: Update both `APP_VERSION` and `VITE_APP_VERSION` to match the new version
4. **Categorize Changes**: Use the following categories:
   - `Added` for new features
   - `Changed` for changes in existing functionality
   - `Deprecated` for soon-to-be removed features
   - `Removed` for now removed features
   - `Fixed` for any bug fixes
   - `Security` for vulnerability fixes

**Example workflow:**
```markdown
## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.1] - 2025-07-08
### Added
- New feature implementation

### Fixed  
- Bug fix description
```

**Important**: Always follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) principles.

## Testing

Backend tests are located in `backend/app/test/` and use pytest with async support. Run tests with `poetry run pytest` in the backend directory.

## Deployment

The application is containerized and deploys with Docker Compose. Services:
- `backend`: FastAPI server on port 8000
- `frontend`: Nginx serving React build on port 3000  
- `db`: PostgreSQL with pgvector on port 5432


## Current State

The application now features a **tabbed interface** for managing multiple diagrams simultaneously. Key components include:

### Multi-Diagram State Management
- **DiagramInstance Interface**: Each tab represents a diagram with `id`, `name`, `type`, `nodes`, `edges`, and timestamps
- **Zustand Store**: Manages `openDiagrams` array and `activeDiagramId` with actions for opening, closing, and switching tabs
- **Legacy Compatibility**: Maintains backward compatibility with existing single-diagram operations

### Tabbed Interface Components
- **DiagramTabs** (`src/components/DiagramTabs.tsx`): Tab bar with Material-UI styling, close buttons, and add new tab functionality
- **DiagramWorkspace** (`src/components/DiagramWorkspace.tsx`): Main ReactFlow canvas area with integrated toolbar and panels
- **App Layout**: Flex-based layout with sidebar, workspace, and generator panel

### Key Features
- Browser-like tab experience with switching and closing
- Automatic tab creation from AI generation
- Empty state handling when no diagrams are open
- All original functionality preserved (save, export, validation, etc.)

New Task
Task: Isolate RAG Context by Diagram Type to Prevent Unwanted IBD Generation

Task Type: Bug Fix / Backend Logic

Context
The current RAG implementation for AI diagram generation is retrieving context without filtering by diagram type. When a user requests a Block Definition Diagram (BDD) with a high number of blocks (e.g., 5 or more), the RAG system finds semantically similar complex diagrams in the database. If those examples happen to include linked Internal Block Diagrams (IBDs), the AI model incorrectly assumes this structure is desired and generates unwanted IBDs alongside the requested BDD. This leads to chaotic and unpredictable diagram creation.

Goal
The primary goal is to refine the RAG retrieval logic to be context-aware. The system must ensure that when generating a diagram of a specific type (e.g., BDD), it only retrieves examples of that same type from the database to use as context.

Acceptance Criteria
✅ Generating a BDD via the AI assistant, regardless of the number of blocks, must not automatically create any associated IBDs.
✅ The semantic search functionality of the RAG system must be modified to filter potential examples by their diagram type.
✅ Manually creating an IBD and linking it to a BDD block should not influence future AI generations that are requested only for BDDs.
✅ The RAG generation process for other diagram types remains functional.

Technical Implementation Details
This is primarily a backend task.

File to Investigate: The logic for RAG-based generation is located in app/database/rag_router.py. The function responsible for querying the vector database needs modification.

Refine the Semantic Search Query:

The database query that performs the similarity search against the diagram_embeddings table must be updated.

It should be modified to include a WHERE clause that filters results based on a diagram_type column. For example: WHERE diagram_type = 'BDD'.

The endpoint POST /api/v1/rag/generate-diagram-with-context/ will need to accept a parameter indicating the type of diagram to be generated so it can pass it to the search query.

Verify Database Schema:

Ensure that the diagram_embeddings table in app/database/models.py has a column to store the diagram type (e.g., diagram_type: Mapped[str]). If not, a database migration will be required to add it. You will need to use poetry run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add diagram_type to embeddings" and then poetry run alembic upgrade head to apply the migration.
