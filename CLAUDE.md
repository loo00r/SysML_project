# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an AI-powered SysML diagram generator built with FastAPI (backend) and React (frontend). The system uses OpenAI's GPT models to generate SysML diagrams from natural language descriptions, with optional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using pgvector for semantic search. The application runs in Docker containers with PostgreSQL as the database.

## Architecture

### Backend Structure
- **FastAPI Application** (`app/main.py`): Main API server with CORS middleware
- **API Routes** (`app/api/api_v1.py`): Router aggregation for all endpoints
- **AI Generation** (`app/AI/diagram_generation.py`): OpenAI integration for SysML diagram generation
- **Database Models** (`app/database/models.py`): SQLAlchemy models for embeddings, templates, and components
- **RAG System** (`app/database/rag_router.py`): Retrieval-Augmented Generation endpoints
- **Configuration** (`app/core/config.py`): Pydantic settings management

### Frontend Structure
- **React + TypeScript** with Material-UI components
- **State Management**: Zustand store (`src/store/diagramStore.ts`)
- **Diagram Editor**: React Flow integration for visual editing
- **AI Integration**: Hooks for AI generation (`src/hooks/useAIGeneration.ts`)
- **SysML Components**: Custom nodes and edges for SysML elements

### Key Components

#### SysML Node Types
- `block`: General system blocks
- `sensor`: Sensor components  
- `processor`: Processing components
- Located in `frontend/src/components/nodes/`

#### Database Schema
- `diagram_embeddings`: Stores diagrams with vector embeddings for RAG
- `sysml_templates`: Reusable diagram templates
- `uav_components`: UAV-specific component definitions

## Environment Configuration

Required environment variables in `.env`:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
OPENAI_GENERATIVE_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://postgres:postgres@db:5432/postgres
DB_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgres@db:5432/postgres
```

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/v1/ping`: Health check
- `POST /api/v1/create-diagram/`: Generate diagram without RAG
- `POST /api/v1/rag/generate-diagram-with-context/`: Generate diagram with RAG
- Database endpoints for embeddings, templates, and components

## Development Notes

- Backend uses Poetry for dependency management
- Frontend uses Vite for development and building
- Database migrations managed with Alembic
- pgvector extension required for semantic search
- OpenAI embeddings use 1536-dimensional vectors
- Diagram positioning is handled automatically by Dagre layout algorithm

### Changelog Maintenance

**After completing each task, you must update the changelog:**

1. **Update CHANGELOG.md**: Add a summary of the changes to the `[Unreleased]` section
2. **Increment Version**: Create a new version entry with incremented patch version (e.g., 1.1.0 → 1.1.1)
3. **Update .env**: Update both `APP_VERSION` and `VITE_APP_VERSION` to match the new version
4. **Categorize Changes**: Use the following categories:
   - `Added` for new features
   - `Changed` for changes in existing functionality
   - `Deprecated` for soon-to-be removed features
   - `Removed` for now removed features
   - `Fixed` for any bug fixes
   - `Security` for vulnerability fixes

**Example workflow:**
```markdown
## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.1] - 2025-07-08
### Added
- New feature implementation

### Fixed  
- Bug fix description
```

**Important**: Always follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) principles.

## Testing

Backend tests are located in `backend/app/test/` and use pytest with async support. Run tests with `poetry run pytest` in the backend directory.

## Deployment

The application is containerized and deploys with Docker Compose. Services:
- `backend`: FastAPI server on port 8000
- `frontend`: Nginx serving React build on port 3000  
- `db`: PostgreSQL with pgvector on port 5432


## Current State

The application now features a **tabbed interface** for managing multiple diagrams simultaneously. Key components include:

### Multi-Diagram State Management
- **DiagramInstance Interface**: Each tab represents a diagram with `id`, `name`, `type`, `nodes`, `edges`, and timestamps
- **Zustand Store**: Manages `openDiagrams` array and `activeDiagramId` with actions for opening, closing, and switching tabs
- **Legacy Compatibility**: Maintains backward compatibility with existing single-diagram operations

### Tabbed Interface Components
- **DiagramTabs** (`src/components/DiagramTabs.tsx`): Tab bar with Material-UI styling, close buttons, and add new tab functionality
- **DiagramWorkspace** (`src/components/DiagramWorkspace.tsx`): Main ReactFlow canvas area with integrated toolbar and panels
- **App Layout**: Flex-based layout with sidebar, workspace, and generator panel

### Key Features
- Browser-like tab experience with switching and closing
- Automatic tab creation from AI generation
- Empty state handling when no diagrams are open
- All original functionality preserved (save, export, validation, etc.)

Task: Enforce Strict Viewport Isolation with Controlled State

Task Type: Frontend / State Management Bug Fix

Context
Despite implementing per-diagram viewport storage and a key-based re-mount, the React Flow canvas state is still being shared between tabs. This indicates that the defaultViewport prop is not sufficient to force a state reset on tab switch. The more robust solution is to use React Flow's controlled component pattern by managing the viewport and onViewportChange props directly.

Goal
To achieve complete viewport isolation by converting the React Flow component to a fully controlled component, ensuring each diagram's pan and zoom state is explicitly loaded and saved.

Acceptance Criteria
✅ Panning and zooming in one diagram tab has zero effect on the viewport of any other tab.
✅ The minimap for each diagram correctly reflects its unique viewport.
✅ Switching to a tab correctly and instantly restores its last saved pan and zoom position.

Technical Implementation Details

Modify the DiagramWorkspace.tsx Component:

File: frontend/src/components/DiagramWorkspace.tsx.

Action: We will change the props passed to the <ReactFlow /> component. Instead of defaultViewport and onMove, we will use viewport and onViewportChange.

Current Code (to be replaced):

TypeScript

// ...
<ReactFlow
  // ... other props
  defaultViewport={activeDiagram?.viewport}
  onMove={(_, viewport) => onViewportChange(viewport)}
  key={activeDiagram?.id}
>
  {/* ... */}
</ReactFlow>
// ...
New, Corrected Code (to replace the block above):

TypeScript

// In DiagramWorkspace.tsx

const DiagramWorkspace = () => {
  // ... existing hooks and state selections ...
  const { activeDiagram, onViewportChange } = useDiagramStore(/* ... */);

  // ...

  return (
    <ReactFlow
      // ... other props ...

      // --- KEY CHANGES ---
      // Use the controlled 'viewport' prop
      viewport={activeDiagram?.viewport} 
      // Use React Flow's dedicated onViewportChange prop
      onViewportChange={onViewportChange}

      // The key prop is still good practice
      key={activeDiagram?.id} 
    >
      {/* ... */}
    </ReactFlow>
  );
};
Note: The onMove prop is more general. onViewportChange is specifically designed for this purpose and is often more reliable for controlled components.

Verify the onViewportChange function in the store:

File: frontend/src/store/diagramStore.ts.

Action: The existing onViewportChange function that your assistant created is already correct for this pattern. No changes are needed there. It correctly finds the active diagram and updates its viewport property.
