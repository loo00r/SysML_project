# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an AI-powered SysML diagram generator built with FastAPI (backend) and React (frontend). The system uses OpenAI's GPT models to generate SysML diagrams from natural language descriptions, with optional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using pgvector for semantic search. The application runs in Docker containers with PostgreSQL as the database.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Build and start all services
docker-compose up --build

# Start services without rebuilding

```

### Backend Development
```bash
# Navigate to backend directory

npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## Architecture

### Backend Structure
- **FastAPI Application** (`app/main.py`): Main API server with CORS middleware
- **API Routes** (`app/api/api_v1.py`): Router aggregation for all endpoints
- **AI Generation** (`app/AI/diagram_generation.py`): OpenAI integration for SysML diagram generation
- **Database Models** (`app/database/models.py`): SQLAlchemy models for embeddings, templates, and components
- **RAG System** (`app/database/rag_router.py`): Retrieval-Augmented Generation endpoints
- **Configuration** (`app/core/config.py`): Pydantic settings management

### Frontend Structure
- **React + TypeScript** with Material-UI components
- **State Management**: Zustand store (`src/store/diagramStore.ts`)
- **Diagram Editor**: React Flow integration for visual editing
- **AI Integration**: Hooks for AI generation (`src/hooks/useAIGeneration.ts`)
- **SysML Components**: Custom nodes and edges for SysML elements

### Key Components

#### SysML Node Types
- `block`: General system blocks
- `sensor`: Sensor components  
- `processor`: Processing components
- Located in `frontend/src/components/nodes/`

#### Database Schema
- `diagram_embeddings`: Stores diagrams with vector embeddings for RAG
- `sysml_templates`: Reusable diagram templates
- `uav_components`: UAV-specific component definitions

## Environment Configuration

Required environment variables in `.env`:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
OPENAI_GENERATIVE_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://postgres:postgres@db:5432/postgres
DB_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgres@db:5432/postgres
```

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/v1/ping`: Health check
- `POST /api/v1/create-diagram/`: Generate diagram without RAG
- `POST /api/v1/rag/generate-diagram-with-context/`: Generate diagram with RAG
- Database endpoints for embeddings, templates, and components

## Development Notes

- Backend uses Poetry for dependency management
- Frontend uses Vite for development and building
- Database migrations managed with Alembic
- pgvector extension required for semantic search
- OpenAI embeddings use 1536-dimensional vectors
- Diagram positioning is handled automatically by Dagre layout algorithm

### Changelog Maintenance

**After completing each task, you must update the changelog:**

1. **Update CHANGELOG.md**: Add a summary of the changes to the `[Unreleased]` section
2. **Increment Version**: Create a new version entry with incremented patch version (e.g., 1.1.0 â†’ 1.1.1)
3. **Update .env**: Update both `APP_VERSION` and `VITE_APP_VERSION` to match the new version
4. **Categorize Changes**: Use the following categories:
   - `Added` for new features
   - `Changed` for changes in existing functionality
   - `Deprecated` for soon-to-be removed features
   - `Removed` for now removed features
   - `Fixed` for any bug fixes
   - `Security` for vulnerability fixes

**Example workflow:**
```markdown
## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.1] - 2025-07-08
### Added
- New feature implementation

### Fixed  
- Bug fix description
```

**Important**: Always follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) principles.

## Testing

Backend tests are located in `backend/app/test/` and use pytest with async support. Run tests with `poetry run pytest` in the backend directory.

## Deployment

The application is containerized and deploys with Docker Compose. Services:
- `backend`: FastAPI server on port 8000
- `frontend`: Nginx serving React build on port 3000  
- `db`: PostgreSQL with pgvector on port 5432


## Current State

The application now features a **tabbed interface** for managing multiple diagrams simultaneously. Key components include:

### Multi-Diagram State Management
- **DiagramInstance Interface**: Each tab represents a diagram with `id`, `name`, `type`, `nodes`, `edges`, and timestamps
- **Zustand Store**: Manages `openDiagrams` array and `activeDiagramId` with actions for opening, closing, and switching tabs
- **Legacy Compatibility**: Maintains backward compatibility with existing single-diagram operations

### Tabbed Interface Components
- **DiagramTabs** (`src/components/DiagramTabs.tsx`): Tab bar with Material-UI styling, close buttons, and add new tab functionality
- **DiagramWorkspace** (`src/components/DiagramWorkspace.tsx`): Main ReactFlow canvas area with integrated toolbar and panels
- **App Layout**: Flex-based layout with sidebar, workspace, and generator panel

### Key Features
- Browser-like tab experience with switching and closing
- Automatic tab creation from AI generation
- Empty state handling when no diagrams are open
- All original functionality preserved (save, export, validation, etc.)

Task: Add IBD Block with Conditional Logic

The objective is to create a new "Internal Block Diagram" (IBD) block type. This new block should replicate all functionality of the existing "System Block" but with distinct visual styling and conditional availability in the UI.

### Implementation Requirements

1.  **Create IBD Node Component:**
    * In the `frontend/src/components/nodes/` directory, duplicate the `SystemBlockNode.tsx` component and rename the copy to `IBDNode.tsx`.
    * Ensure the new `IBDNode` inherits all functionality from the original `SystemBlockNode`.
    * Modify the styling of the `IBDNode` component to have a distinct **green** color for its border or background.

2.  **Integrate into Sidebar:**
    * Add the new "IBD" block to the "Diagram Elements" list in the left sidebar.
    * It must be draggable onto the canvas, functioning identically to the "System Block".

3.  **Implement Conditional Locking:**
    * In the sidebar component, access the active diagram's `type` from the `diagramStore` (Zustand).
    * Implement logic to lock the "IBD" block in the sidebar when the active diagram is a **"BDD" (Block Definition Diagram)**.
    * The locked state should be visually indicated (e.g., grayed out) and should prevent the block from being dragged onto the canvas.
    * The "IBD" block must be enabled and fully functional for all other diagram types.
